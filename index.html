    <p>My name is Sana Khan. I work at DaVita Kidney Care as a Data Integrity Specialist. 
      I'm very excited about this boot camp course. Hopefully, I can use the skills that I 
      learn to become an analyst in the healthcare setting.

      I live in Denver, CO. I have two dogs - a pomeranian and a husky. In my spare time, I love watching 
      CNBC and any DC/Marvel shows or movies. I love the outdoors and long drives. My most favorite pass
      time is to code and read how-to books on coding. I'm very excited for this course! Boot camp rocks!

      So far, I have created a title and initialized my html project. I have set the header to reflect
